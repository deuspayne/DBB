autonuke.js
	- daemonized
	- 

autoGrow.js
	- impliment max wait to sleep before running again (will be slower than checking each and every batch for now)

script to find all *close* servers
	- ones that are within x% of current hack
	- ones that can be hacked, but missing port openers

scpf.js
	- catch exceptions for trying to scp files that aren't vaild

serverMonitor.js
	- check to see that there are scripts running (IN PROGRESS)
	- display servers that have money to be hacked, listed as the state they're in
		* weaken
		* grow
		* hack
	- display progress as bar
	
ports
	- there's also a bunch here about auto complete getting better
	- perhaps use them to put 1 piece of data in, json object. that's used to pop and push new data in with list of servers running it.
		* autoGrow.js would put a list of new servers in when it launches the ws.js and gs.js processes
		* ws.js and gs.js update stripped of the server it's running on.
		* pop first, then push. should always be null when pushing in new data (error out if this happens?).
		* null data on read means wait
